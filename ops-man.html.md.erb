Ops Manager is a web application that you use to deploy and manage a [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) PaaS.
This is a guide to deploying and using Ops Manager.

## <a id='ops-man-ui'></a> Ops Manager UI

Use the Ops Manager UI to install PCF products and configure their settings.

For more information on the Ops Manager UI, see [Using the Ops Manager UI](./ops-man-ui.html).

## <a id='ops-man-api'></a> Ops Manager API, CLI, and Platform Automation (Beta)

Use the Ops Manager API, `om` CLI, and Platform Automation (Beta) tasks to manage PCF installations programmatically, from the command line, or from an automation pipeline.

See the [Ops Manager API, CLI, and Platform Automation (Beta)](./ops-man-api-cli.html) topic to learn how to get started using these Ops Manager tools.
